Problems with \newcommand
Seems to be to do with the async parameter used to load the MathJax.js script
If it is remove all works properly

Problems with table_styling extension.  Error in jinja2
https://foss.heptapod.net/doc-utils/cloud_sptheme/-/issues/48
See jinja_PatchFile
cloud_sptheme-ext-index_styling.py needs to be copied to /home/john/.conda/envs/develop/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cloud_sptheme/ext/index_styling.py for instance.

The following pip install's are reqired:

pip install sphinx-autoapi
pip install sphinxcontrib.bibtex
pip install cloud_sptheme
pip install furo

To fix the cloud_sptheme.
# Store the current sphinx directory in a variable
t=`pwd`
# cd to the cloud_sptheme library
cd /home/john/.conda/envs/QT6/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cloud_sptheme/ext
# cp the index_styling file and patch it
cp index_styling.py index_stylin.py.old
patch < $t/jinja_PatchFile
