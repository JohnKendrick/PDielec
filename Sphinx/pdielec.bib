abstract = {To streamline the interpretation of vibrational spectra, this work introduces the use of Bayesian linear regression with automatic relevance determination as a viable approach to decompose the atomic motions along any vibrational mode as a weighted combination of displacements along chemically meaningful internal coordinates. This novel approach denominated vibrational mode automatic relevance determination (VMARD) is presented and compared with the well-established potential energy decomposition (PED) scheme. Good agreement is generally attained between the two methods. VMARD returns a decomposition of the atomic displacement using only a small number of internal coordinates, thus aiding the interpretation of the vibrational spectra. Moreover, the results show that the VMARD descriptions are resilient toward the addition of additional internal coordinates, achieving a concise description of the vibrational modes despite the use of redundant internal coordinates. Potential applications of VMARD involving the gathering of physical insights on the atomic motions along the reaction coordinate at transition state structures, as well as the improvement of theoretically predicted vibrational frequencies, are also presented under a proof-of-concept perspective.},

abstract = {ABINIT is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy, charge density, electronic structure and many other properties of systems made of electrons and nuclei, (molecules and periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT), Many-Body Perturbation Theory (GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter equation) and Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). ABINIT also allows to optimize the geometry according to the DFT forces and stresses, to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these forces, and to generate dynamical matrices, Born effective charges and dielectric tensors. The present paper aims to describe the new capabilities of ABINIT that have been developed since 2009. It covers both physical and technical developments inside the ABINIT code, as well as developments provided within the ABINIT package. The developments are described with relevant references, input variables, tests and tutorials. Program summary Program title: ABINIT Catalogue identifier: AEEU_v2_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEU_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 4845789 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 71340403 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran2003, PERL scripts, Python scripts. Classification: 7.3, 7.8. External routines: (all optional) BigDFT [2], ETSF_IO [3], libxc [4], NetCDF [5], MPI [6], Wannier90 [7], FFTW [8]. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEU_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 2582 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. The abinit-7.10.5 version is now the up to date stable version of ABINIT Nature of problem: This package has the purpose of computing accurately material and nanostructure properties: electronic structure, bond lengths, bond angles, primitive cell size, cohesive energy, dielectric properties, vibrational properties, elastic properties, optical properties, magnetic properties, non-linear couplings, electronic and vibrational life-times, and others. Solution method: Software application based on Density Functional Theory, Many-Body Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mean Field Theory, pseudopotentials, with plane waves or wavelets as basis functions. Reasons for new version: Since 2009, the abinit-5.7.4 version of the code has considerably evolved and is not yet up to date. The abinit- 7.10.5 version contains new physical and technical features that allow electronic structure calculations impossible to carry out in the previous versions. Summary of revisions: • new physical features: quantum effects for the nuclei treated by the Path-integral Molecular Dynamics; finding transition states using image dynamics (NEB or string methods); two component DFT for electron-positron annihilation; linear response in a Projector Augmented-Wave approach -PAW-, electron-phonon interactions and temperature dependence of the gap; Bethe Salpeter Equation -BSE-; Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).• new technical features: development of a PAW approach for a wavelet basis; parallelisation of the code on more than 10,000 processors; new build system.• new features in the ABINIT package: tests; test farm; new tutorials; new pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data tables; GUI and postprocessing tools like the AbiPy and APPA libraries. Running time: It is difficult to answer to the question as the use of ABINIT is very large. On one hand, ABINIT can run on 10,000 processors for hours to perform quantum molecular dynamics on large systems. On the other hand, tutorials for students can be performed on a laptop within a few minutes.

@article{Dovesi2014,
abstract = {The capabilities of the CRYSTAL14 program are presented, and the improvements made with respect to the previous CRYSTAL09 version discussed. CRYSTAL14 is an ab initio code that uses a Gaussian-type basis set: both pseudopotential and all-electron strategies are permitted; the latter is not much more expensive than the former up to the first-second transition metal rows of the periodic table. A variety of density functionals is available, including as an extreme case Hartree-Fock; hybrids of various nature (global, range-separated, double) can be used. In particular, a very efficient implementation of global hybrids, such as popular B3LYP and PBE0 prescriptions, allows for such calculations to be performed at relatively low computational cost. The program can treat on the same grounds zero-dimensional (molecules), one-dimensional (polymers), two-dimensional (slabs), as well as three-dimensional (3D; crystals) systems. No spurious 3D periodicity is required for low-dimensional systems as happens when plane-waves are used as a basis set. Symmetry is fully exploited at all steps of the calculation; this permits, for example, to investigate nanotubes of increasing radius at a nearly constant cost (better than linear scaling!) or to perform self-consistent-field (SCF) calculations on fullerenes as large as (10,10), with 6000 atoms, 84,000 atomic orbitals, and 20 SCF cycles, on a single core in one day. Three versions of the code exist, serial, parallel, and massive-parallel. In the second one, the most relevant matrices are duplicated, whereas in the third one the matrices in reciprocal space are distributed for diagonalization. All the relevant vectors are now dynamically allocated and deallocated after use, making CRYSTAL14 much more agile than the previous version, in which they were statically allocated. The program now fits more easily in low-memory machines (as many supercomputers nowadays are). CRYSTAL14 can be used on parallel machines up to a high number of cores (benchmarks up to 10,240 cores are documented) with good scalability, the main limitation remaining the diagonalization step. Many tensorial properties can be evaluated in a fully automated way by using a single input keyword: elastic, piezoelectric, photoelastic, dielectric, as well as first and second hyperpolarizabilies, electric field gradients, Born tensors and so forth. Many tools permit a complete analysis of the vibrational properties of crystalline compounds. The infrared and Raman intensities are now computed analytically and related spectra can be generated. Isotopic shifts are easily evaluated, frequencies of only a fragment of a large system computed and nuclear contribution to the dielectric tensor determined. New algorithms have been devised for the investigation of solid solutions and disordered systems. The topological analysis of the electron charge density, according to the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules, is now incorporated in the code via the integrated merge of the TOPOND package. Electron correlation can be evaluated at the Moller-Plesset second-order level (namely MP2) and a set of double-hybrids are presently available via the integrated merge with the CRYSCOR program.

The concentration of paramagnetic radiation-induced defects in kaolinite reaches 2 x 10(16) spins/mg (400 at. ppm), as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The broadening of X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission infrared (IR) absorption bands is mostly related to the structural strain induced by radiation-induced point defects. The broadening of IR absorption spectra is analyzed using an autocorrelation approach and is related to a change in the distribution of vibrational frequencies due to crystal heterogeneities. We theoretically analyze how the effective dielectric properties of kaolinite samples depend on macroscopic parameters and how irradiation can modify some of them. Irradiation leads to an increase in the electronic polarizability of kaolinite particles, related to the accumulation of radiation-induced electronic point defects.},

abstract = {Many organisms contain proteins which regulate the size and shape of inorganic crystals in their skeletal elements, most likely through specific protein-crystal surface interactions. As a model for better understanding such control of crystal morphology, an a-helical peptide (CBP1) was synthesized having an array of aspartyl residues designed to bind to the 110 prism faces of calcite. When added to a saturated solution of calcium bicarbonate containing rhombohedral calcite seed crystals, CBP1 had a remarkable effect on subsequent calcite growth, depending on growth conditions. At 3 degrees C, where CBP1 is 89\% helical, the crystals assumed a prismatic habit, with growth continuing along the c-axis, but inhibited parallel to the c-axis and prism faces; at 25 degrees C, where CBP1 is largely unstructured, studded crystals formed, resulting from epitaxial growth off each of the six rhombohedral surfaces. Other acidic peptides also caused similar epitaxial growth. These results suggest that the helical form of the peptide recognizes specific crystal surface characteristics, whereas the unfolded form acts nonspecifically as a polyanion. When the peptide was removed from the growth medium containing either type of crystal, regrowth of 104 rhombohedral surfaces ensued at the expense of the nonrhombohedral surfaces. These results represent the first example of conformation-dependent control of calcite crystal growth by a peptide of defined secondary structure.},

abstract = {Normal vibrational modes for a three-dimensional defect-free crystal of the high explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate were obtained in the framework of classical mechanics using a previously published unreactive potential-energy surface [J. Phys. Chem. B 112, 734 (2008)]. Using these results the vibrational density of states was obtained for the entire vibrational frequency range. Relaxation of selectively excited terahertz-active modes was studied using isochoric-isoergic (NVE) molecular dynamics simulations for energy and density conditions corresponding to room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Dependence of the relaxation time on the initial modal excitation was considered for five excitation energies between 10 and 500 kT and shown to be relatively weak. The terahertz absorption spectrum was constructed directly using linewidths obtained from the relaxation times of the excited modes for the case of 10 kT excitation. The spectrum shows reasonably good agreement with experimental results. Dynamics of redistribution of the excited mode energy among the other normal modes was also studied. The results indicate that, for the four terahertz-active initially excited modes considered, there is a small subset of zero wave vector (k = 0) modes that preferentially absorb the energy on a few-picosecond time scale. The majority of the excitation energy, however, is transferred nonspecifically to the bath modes of the system.},

The resulting potential parameters for the CO32- group were then transferred to models for the structures and bulk moduli of the carbonate minerals incorporating Mn, Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn, Co, Cd, and thus a fully consistent set of interaction parameters for calculating the properties of the carbonate minerals was obtained. Defect energies for doping the divalent cations into the calcite structure, and for calcium and carbonate ion vacancies were calculated. In addition, various disorder types for dolomite, including anti-site defects, stacking defects, and the energy related to increasing the Ca/Mg ratio in the dolomite structure were simulated. The theoretical enthalpy for dolomite ordering (34.4 kJ/mol) compares very well with experimental measurements.},

Spectral features are found to shift to lower frequencies as the molecular mass is increased, as expected. However, to understand the detailed structure of the observed spectral features, density functional perturbation theory calculations have been performed on the first four crystalline compounds in the series. From these calculations, we find that each spectrum is dominated by three translatory modes involving asymmetric motion of the ammonium cation and bromine counterion, although the overall number of active modes increases with increasing molecular size. The experimentally observed absorption is not completely described by the infrared active phonon modes alone. We show that it is also necessary to include the coupling of the phonon modes with the macroscopic field generated by the collective displacement of the vibrating ions, and we have applied an effective medium theory, which accounts for particle shape to allow for this effect in the calculation of the terahertz spectra.},

The active nature of the homogenized composite materials (HCMs) arises from one of the component materials which takes the form of InAs/GaAs quantum dots. Provided that the real parts of the permittivities of the component materials have the same sign, the Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms give physically plausible estimates of the HCM permittivity dyadic that are in close agreement. However, if the real parts of the permittivities of the component materials have different signs then there are substantial differences between the Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett estimates. These differences are slightly less pronounced if the relative permittivity of the metallic component material is described by the extended version of the Drude formula appropriate to very small particles. However, these differences become enormous - with the Bruggeman estimate being physically implausible - as the imaginary parts of the permittivities of the component materials tend to zero. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Terahertz spectroscopy provides direct information concerning weak intermolecular forces in crystalline molecular solids and therefore acts as an excellent method for calibrating and evaluating computational models for noncovalent interactions. In this study, the low-frequency vibrations of two dipeptides were compared, acyclic diglycine and cyclic diglycine, as benchmark systems for gauging the performance of semiempirical London force correction approaches. The diglycine samples were investigated using pulsed terahertz spectroscopy from 10 to 100 cm(-1) and then analyzed using solid-state density functional theory (DFT) augmented with existing London force corrections, as well as a new parametrization (DFT-DX) based on known experimental values. The two diglycine molecules provide a useful test for the applied models given their similarities, but more importantly the differences in the intermolecular forces displayed by each. It was found that all of the considered London force correction models were able to generate diglycine crystal structures of similar accuracy, but considerable variation occurred in their abilities to predict terahertz frequency vibrations. The DFT-DX parametrization was particularly successful in this investigation and shows promise for the improved analysis of low-frequency spectra.},

In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (H-2, H2O, Li-2, N-2, F-2, BF3, SiF4) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF2, Fe, Co, Ni). Particular attention is paid to the bulk properties and magnetic energies of Fe, Co, and Ni. [S0163-1829(98)00848-0].},

The algorithm is capable of treating any number of layers of arbitrarily anisotropic, birefringent, and absorbing media and is implemented in an open-access computer program. We derive explicit expressions for the transmitted and absorbed power at any point in the multilayer structure, using the electric field distribution from a 4×4 transfer matrix formalism. As a test ground, we study three nanophotonic device structures featuring unique layer-resolved absorption characteristics, making use of (i) in-plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons, (ii) layer-selective, cavity-enhanced exciton absorption in transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers, and (iii) intersubband-cavity polaritons in quantum wells. Covering such a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the visible, the case studies demonstrate the generality and wide applicability of our approach.},

@article{Pierre2013a,
abstract = {It is shown that ab initio simulation can be used as a powerful complementary tool in the interpretation of the experimental reflectance spectra R($\nu$) of crystalline compounds. Experimental frequencies and intensities are obtained from a best fit of R($\nu$) with a set of damped harmonic oscillators, whose number and initial position in frequency can dramatically influence the final results, as the parameters are strongly correlated. Computed ab initio values for frequencies and intensities are accurate enough to represent an excellent starting point for the best fit process. Moreover, at variance with respect to experiment, simulation permits to identify all the symmetry allowed modes, also when characterized by low intensity or when close to a very intense peak. Overall, simulation-aided analysis of experimental spectra prevents from classifying combination modes as fundamental modes and permits to discard artifacts due to superposition of bands, background, and noise. Finally, it allows to (almost) completely characterize the set of fundamental modes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {We present a novel way to account for partially coherent interference in multilayer systems via the transfer-matrix method. The novel feature is that there is no need to use modified Fresnel coefficients or the square of their amplitudes to work in the incoherent limit. The transition from coherent to incoherent interference is achieved by introducing a random phase of increasing intensity in the propagating media. This random phase can simulate the effect of defects or impurities. This method provides a general way of dealing with optical multilayer systems, in which coherent and incoherent interference are treated on equal footing.
