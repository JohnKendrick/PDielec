This is the documentation for the PDielec package.  The package takes output from DFT calculations and calculates a material's infrared and terahertz response.  
For single crystals (thin films or slabs) a generalized transfer matrix is used.  for powdered material in a support matrix an effective medium theory is used which can take into accounnt the effect of shape and particle size.
