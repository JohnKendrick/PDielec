.. py:class:: FixedQTableWidget(*args, parent=None, rows=None, columns=None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`PyQt5.QtWidgets.QTableWidget`

   A custom QTableWidget with fixed number of rows and columns.

   This widget is designed to have a fixed size based on a specified number of rows and columns, rather than adjusting dynamically to the content it displays. If the number of rows and columns isn't specifically provided, it defaults to the current count of rows and columns in the widget.

   Parameters
   ----------
   args
       Variable length argument list.
   parent : Optional[QWidget]
       The parent widget. Default is None.
   rows : Optional[int]
       The fixed number of rows for the table. If None, the table's row count is used. Default is None.
   columns : Optional[int]
       The fixed number of columns for the table. If None, the table's column count is used. Default is None.

   Methods
   -------
   sizeHint()
       Calculates and returns the recommended size for the table widget based on the fixed number of rows and columns, or based on its current row and column counts if no fixed numbers are provided.

   See Also
   --------
   QTableWidget : The base class from which this class is derived.

   .. py:method:: sizeHint()

      Calculate the suggested dimensions for the widget based on its content.

      This method calculates the preferred size of the widget by summing up the widths of all columns and the heights of all rows, including any scrollbars, headers, and frame widths.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      QSize
          The calculated size that suggests the optimal dimensions for the widget. The width is determined by the total width of all columns, the vertical header width, the vertical scrollbar width, and twice the frame width. The height is determined by the total height of all rows, the horizontal header height, the horizontal scrollbar height, and twice the frame width.

   .. py:method:: on_optical_tw_itemClicked(item)

      Handle item clicked event for an optical widget's table item.

      This method is designed to be connected to the itemClicked signal of a table widget
      in a graphical user interface built with PyQt or PySide. When a table widget item
      is clicked, it first prints the start message along with the row and column of the
      clicked item. It then unblocks signals for the table widget and processes any pending
      GUI events, ensuring the application remains responsive. 

      Parameters
      ----------
      item : QTableWidgetItem
          The table widget item that was clicked.

      Returns
      -------
      None


   .. py:method:: on_output_tw_itemChanged(item)

      Handle item changes in the output table widget.

      This method is called when an item in the output table widget (`output_tw`) is changed. It manages the selection state of modes based on the state of checkbox items in the first column, updates the "sigmas_cm1" and "frequencies_cm1" lists based on the user input in the respective columns, refreshes the widget, and processes pending GUI events.

      Parameters
      ----------
      item : QTableWidgetItem
          The table widget item that was changed.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      - This method blocks signals from the output table widget at the beginning to prevent recursive calls during its execution.
      - It distinguishes between changes in the first column (selection state and mode sigma values) and the second column (frequency values).
      - The method updates internal state to reflect the changes made by the user, including which modes are selected and the values for "sigmas_cm1" and "frequencies_cm1".
      - After making changes, this method refreshes the output table widget and enforces a GUI update with `QCoreApplication.processEvents()`.

      See Also
      --------
      redraw_output_tw : Redraws the output table widget.
      refresh : Refreshes the internal state based on the latest changes.


   .. py:method:: on_sigma_changed()

      Updates the sigma value in settings and applies it across the frequency range, then refreshes the output.

      This method is triggered when the sigma value has been changed. It updates the stored sigma value in the settings,
      applies the new sigma value across the pre-defined frequency range, redraws the output table widget, and then
      initiates a refresh to reflect the newly applied changes.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None


   .. py:method:: redraw_output_tw()

      Redraws the output table widget with updated values.

      This method loops through frequencies, sigmas, and intensities, updating the table widget rows
      with new items representing these values and custom flags for item behavior. It also calculates
      and displays additional derived values in the table. Selection flags for each item are set
      based on whether the mode is selected or not. The table's columns are resized to content at the end.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      - This method assumes that `self.frequencies_cm1`, `self.sigmas_cm1`, `self.intensities`, and `self.modes_selected` contain iterable values that are indexed correspondingly.
      - The method temporarily blocks signals from `self.output_tw` to prevent unwanted signal handling during updates.
      - Table item flags are set to control their selectability, checkability, editability, and enablement based on whether the corresponding mode is selected.
      - After updating, it ensures the table columns fit the content and re-enables the signals.
      - Uses `Qt` enumeration for setting check state, item flags, and text alignment.



   .. py:method:: refresh(force=False)

      Refreshes the current state based on notebook content changes or user request.

      This method updates the GUI components such as tables for masses, optical permittivity, sigma value, Eckart term checkbox, and Born charges checkbox based on the changes made in the notebook or when forced by the user. It also triggers refreshes for any associated scenarios, plotting, analysis, and fitting tabs. The method blocks all signals from widgets during the update process to prevent unwanted calls to event handlers.

      Parameters
      ----------
      force : bool, optional
          If True, forces the refresh even if it's deemed not necessary. The default is False.

      -----
      - Blocks all QWidget signals before starting the update process to prevent unintended event handling.
      - Updates various GUI components based on the current notebook's reader and settings information.
      - Triggers refreshes on associated tabs and scenarios within the notebook.
      - Unblocks all QWidget signals after updates are applied.
      - Manages internal flags to keep track of the need for refreshes and calculations.
      - Processes all pending Qt events with `QCoreApplication.processEvents()`.

          - `self.optical_tw` is a Qt TableWidget or similar object with a `.setItem()` method accepting row, column, and QTableWidgetItem arguments.
          - The table widget's signals are temporarily blocked to prevent unintended side-effects during the update.
          - `Qt.AlignHCenter | Qt.AlignVCenter` is used to center-align the text, assuming `Qt` and `QTableWidgetItem` are properly imported and used.
