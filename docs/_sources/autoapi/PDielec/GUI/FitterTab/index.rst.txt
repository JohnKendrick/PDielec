   parent : QWidget
       The parent widget.
   debug : bool, optional
       Flag to indicate whether debugging messages should be printed, by default False.

   Attributes
   ----------
   parent : QWidget
       The parent QWidget within which this `FitterTab` is contained.
   debug : bool, optional
       A flag to activate debug mode which provides additional output for development and troubleshooting. Defaults to False.

   Notes
   -----
   This class is designed to provide a user interface for spectral fitting tasks, allowing for adjustments of various fitting parameters and visualization of fitting results. It leverages Qt widgets for the graphical user interface components and matplotlib for plotting.

   The class initializes with customizable settings related to spectral fitting including file names, fitting types, iterations, scaling factors, and baseline correction options. It supports reading experimental data from .xlsx or .csv files, setting fitting parameters through a dynamically generated form, and presenting the fitting results graphically with options to adjust the view.

      - Processes all pending events for the application to ensure UI updates are immediately applied.



   .. py:method:: on_spectrafile_le_changed(text)

      Handle changes to the spectra file input field.

      This method is triggered when the text of the spectrum file input field changes. It updates the 'Experimental file name' setting with the new text, marks the current experimental file as unread, and indicates that a refresh is required.

      Parameters
      ----------
      text : str
          The new text from the spectra file input field. Not directly used after method update.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The actual text used in processing is fetched directly from the `spectrafile_le` attribute, not from the `text` argument.



   .. py:method:: on_spectrafile_le_return()

      Handle file selection for experimental spectra.

      This method is executed when an action associated with the `spectrafile_le` widget is performed. It prompts the user to select a file if the currently specified file does not exist or cannot be found. It updates the application's settings with the new file name, if a file is selected.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The method first checks if the file specified in the `spectrafile_le` widget exists. If it does not, a file dialog is opened for the user to select a file. If a file is selected, the method updates the application's settings and the text of the `spectrafile_le` widget to reflect the new file name. Additionally, it sets a flag indicating that a refresh is required and that the experimental file needs to be read again. Finally, it triggers the last button pressed action.

      This method utilizes `os.path.isfile` to check file existence, `QFileDialog` for file selection. 



   .. py:method:: on_spectral_difference_threshold_sb_changed(value)

      Handle changes in spectral difference threshold setting.

      This function is called when the 'Spectral difference threshold' setting is changed.
      It updates the setting value, converting it to a float, and sets a flag indicating that a refresh is required.

      Parameters
      ----------
      value : str
          The new value for the 'Spectral difference threshold' setting. The function attempts to convert this to a float.

      Parameters
      ----------
      value : bool
          The new value of the spectrum scaling checkbox. The specific type and significance can vary depending on the implementation details of the checkbox and its handlers.

      Returns
      -------
      None



   .. py:method:: on_spectrum_scaling_factor_sb_changed(value)

      Handle the change in spectrum scaling factor.

      Parameters
      ----------
      value : str
          The new value for the spectrum scaling factor. Expected to be convertible to float.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This function attempts to update the 'Spectrum scaling factor' setting with the new value after converting it to float. If the conversion fails, a message is printed indicating the failure.



   .. py:method:: optimiseFit()

      Optimise the fit based on the initial and adjusted sigmas and potential frequency scaling.

      Instructions for determining the best fitting parameters for the model are conducted
      within the constraints of predefined modes. The function iterates to minimize the discrepancy
      between modeled and experimental data. It employs the Nelder-Mead optimization method for
      solving the problem.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      list or OptimizeResult
          The final optimization point as a list if no sigma has been selected for optimisation,
          or as an `OptimizeResult` object returned by `scipy.optimize.minimize`. The return type
          depends on whether the optimization process is executed.

      Notes
      -----
      The function uses several attributes of the class instance it belongs to:
      - `modes_fitted` to determine which modes are fitted.
      - `sigmas_cm1` as initial sigma points for optimization.
      - `settings` to check if frequency scaling should be optimised and to determine the number of iterations for the optimization.
      - `optimiseFunction` as the function to be minimized.

      It modifies the `functionCalls` attribute by setting it to 0 at the beginning and uses
      `fit_list` to store the indexes of modes that are being fitted.



   .. py:method:: optimiseFunction(variables)

      Optimise the fitting function based on given variables.

      This method adjusts internal settings based on an array of variables to
      optimise the fitting function according to the predefined criteria
      (e.g., minimize cross-correlation or spectral difference). It updates
      GUI components and recalculates the function value based on the new
      configuration.

      Parameters
      ----------
      variables : list or array-like
          The variables used for optimization. This could include sigma values
          for each element to be fitted and optionally a scaling factor for
          frequency scaling, depending on the configuration.

      Returns
      -------
      float
          The function value after optimization, which is either the negative
          cross-correlation or the root mean square error (RMSE), based on the
          fitting type setting.

      Notes
      -----
      - `calculationInProgress` is a boolean attribute of the
        object that indicates whether a calculation can proceed.
      - Manipulates GUI components such as `fittingButton` and elements within
        `notebook.settingsTab`, thus requires the GUI to be in a responsive state.
      - Uses global `debugger` object for logging progress and results.
      - The method updates the internal state of the object, such as the
        `functionCalls` counter and sigma values for elements being fitted.

      Raises
      ------
      Exception
          If the calculation is not in progress (indicated by
          `calculationInProgress` being `False`), it immediately returns a
          predefined extremely negative value (e.g., -9.9e+99).



   .. py:method:: plot(experiment, xs, ys, legends, label)

      Plot experimental and calculated data on the same or separate y-axes.

      This method plots provided experimental and calculated data sets using Matplotlib. It supports plotting
      data with independent y-axes and applying frequency shift and scaling to the x-axis. The plot appearance,
      including color mapping, line width, and labels, is customizable.

      Parameters
      ----------
      experiment : array_like
          The experimental data to be plotted. If empty, no experimental data is plotted.
      xs : list of array_like
          A list containing the x-axis data for each data set.
      ys : list of array_like
          A list containing the y-axis data for each data set to be plotted alongside the x data.
      legends : list of str
          A list containing the labels for each data set.
      label : str
          The label for the plot, typically used as a part of y-axis label.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Raises
      ------
      ValueError
          If `xs`, `ys`, and `legends` lists do not have the same length.



   .. py:method:: print_settings()

      Print the settings attributes of the instance.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Prints the key and value of each setting in the instance's `settings` attribute, with the help of the `debugger` print method.



   .. py:method:: redraw_sigmas_tw()

      Redraw the table widget for sigmas.

      This method updates the table widget `sigmas_tw` used for displaying sigma, frequency, and intensity
      information. It checks if the data lists (`sigmas_cm1`, `frequencies_cm1`, and `intensities`) are non-empty
      and then proceeds to populate the table. Each row in the table corresponds to a unique sigma, frequency,
      and intensity value. The method also handles item selection and editing properties based on the state of
      `modes_selected` and `modes_fitted` attributes.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      - `sigmas_cm1`, `frequencies_cm1`, and `intensities` are lists that store sigma, frequency, and intensity data, respectively.
      - `modes_selected` and `modes_fitted` are lists that store boolean values indicating whether a mode is selected and
        whether it is fitted, respectively.



   .. py:method:: refresh(force=False)

      Refresh the state of the application based on user-defined conditions and settings.

      Parameters
      ----------
      force : bool, optional
          If True, the refresh proceeds regardless of whether it is deemed necessary based on the internal state. Defaults to False.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The refresh process involves several key steps including checking if a refresh is required, updating plotting data from settings, reading an experimental file, setting GUI components based on notebook scenarios, and recalculating spectra. If the refresh is aborted either due to being unnecessary or because there are no frequencies, it returns early. Additionally, if `force` is True, it ignores the check for whether a refresh is required and proceeds with the refresh.

      After updating relevant class attributes and GUI components, the function recalculates cross-correlation, root-mean-square error (RMSE) between experimental and calculated spectra, and updates the display with these metrics.



   .. py:method:: replot()

      Replots the experimental spectrum along with calculated frequencies and spectra.

      This method will initially check if there is a resampled experimental spectrum. If such a spectrum exists, the spectrum is resampled. Subsequently, it calls the plot method with the updated data along with other related information such as legends and labels.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None



   .. py:method:: replotButton1Clicked()

      Handle the click event on the replot button.

      This method is triggered when the replot button is clicked. It sets up the necessary flags for the replot operation and invokes the refresh method to update the plot.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This method modifies the instance attributes to reflect that a replot is required without a frequency shift, and it bookmarks the last button pressed as 'replotButton1Clicked'. It also calls the `self.refresh` method to initiate the replotting process.



   .. py:method:: replotButton2Clicked()

      Handle the event when the second replot button is clicked.

      This method updates various attributes to indicate that a refresh of the plot is required,
      specifically with a frequency shift. It records that this button was the last one pressed
      and then initiates the refresh process.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None



   .. py:method:: requestRefresh()

       - lag: The lag at which the maximum correlation occurs.
       - max_corr: The maximum correlation value.
       - center_corr: The correlation value at the center (zero lag).

   Notes
   -----
   The calculated spectrum's x-axis is rescaled according to the `scaling_factor`. The correlation is performed on the normalized (zero-mean unit-variance) spectra. Interpolation of the calculated spectrum onto the experimental spectrum's x-axis is performed using cubic interpolation.



.. py:function:: calculateSpectralDifference(xaxis, calculated_spectrum, experimental_spectrum, spectral_threshold=0.05, scaling_factor=1.0, debug=False)

   Calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) between a renormalised experimental spectrum and calculated spectrum after applying a scaling factor.

       The experimental spectrum
   scaling_factor : float, optional
       The factor by which the x-axis of the calculated spectrum is scaled, default is 1.0
   spectral_threshold : float,optional
       Only signals greater than the threshold are considered in the difference calculation. Default is 0.05
   debug : boolean, optional
       Set to true for debugging information

   Returns
   -------
   float
       The root mean square error between the resampled experimental spectrum and the scaled calculated spectrum.

   Notes
   -----
   - This method modifies the spectra by scaling, normalization, and thresholding before calculating the RMSE.
   - If the resampled experimental spectrum is empty, the method returns 0.0 immediately.
   - Uses cubic interpolation for scaling the calculated spectrum.
   - Normalization is performed based on the maximum value in the experimental spectrum.

       True if debug information is needed, default is False

   Returns
   -------
   experimental_frequencies : an array of floats
       The experimental frequencies in cm-1
   experimental_spectrum : an array of floats
       The experimental spectrum

   Errors
   ------
   If any errors occur, such as a file not existing, empty arrays/lists are returned, :w



.. py:function:: resample_experimental_spectrum(calculated_frequencies, experimental_frequencies, experimental_spectrum, baseline_removal='False', HPFilter_lambda=7.0, debug=False)

   Resample the experimental spectrum to match calculated frequencies and optionally apply baseline removal.

   This method modifies the experimental spectrum to align with the calculated 
   frequencies. It pads the spectrum at both ends with zeros outside the calculated
   frequencies range, then uses cubic interpolation over the whole range. 
   If 'baseline_removal' is enabled, applies the Hodrick-Prescott filter 
   for baseline removal on the resampled spectrum.

   Parameters
   ----------
   calculated_frequencies : array of floats
       The frequencies the caculated spectrum is tabulated 
   experimental_frequencies : array of floats
       The frequencies the experimental spectrum is tabulated 
   experimental_spectrum : array of floats
       The experimental spectrum
   baseline_removal : boolean
       Optional switches on baseline removal using a Hodrick-Prescott filter, default is False
   HPFilter_lambda : float
       The value of lambda in in the Hodrick-Prescott filter, default value is 7.0
   debug : boolean
       Optional switches on some debug information, default is False

   Returns
   -------
   None
       Modifies the instance's resampled_experimental_spectrum in place.
