:py:mod:`PDielec.p1reader`
==========================

.. py:module:: PDielec.p1reader

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Read the contents of a single file containing DFT output and create a csv style file of information

   Parse command-line arguments to set program configuration and process a specified file.

   This function does not have a formal return but exits with different messages and statuses based on the command-line inputs. It processes various command-line arguments to configure the behavior of a software utility, specifically targeting file analysis with support for multiple programs. It also supports debug mode and handles command-line requests for help and version information.

   Parameters
   ----------
   This function does not accept parameters directly through its definition. Instead, it uses command-line arguments parsed from `sys.argv`:

   - `-debug` : Enable debug mode.
   - `-help` : Print help message and exit.
   - `-version` : Print software version and exit.
   - `-program` : Specify the program to use for analysis. When set to 'phonopy', an additional quantum mechanics program argument is required.
   - Any other argument is considered as the filename for analysis.

.. py:function:: main()

   Parse command-line arguments to set program configuration and process a specified file.

   This function does not have a formal return but exits with different messages and statuses based on the command-line inputs. It processes various command-line arguments to configure the behavior of a software utility, specifically targeting file analysis with support for multiple programs. It also supports debug mode and handles command-line requests for help and version information.

   Parameters
   ----------
   This function does not accept parameters directly through its definition. Instead, it uses command-line arguments parsed from `sys.argv`:
   - `-debug` : Enable debug mode.
   - `-help` : Print help message and exit.
   - `-version` : Print software version and exit.
   - `-program` : Specify the program to use for analysis. When set to 'phonopy', an additional quantum mechanics program argument is required.
   - Any other argument is considered as the filename for analysis.

   Raises
   ------
   SystemExit
       This function may call `exit()` which stops script execution and can be considered as raising `SystemExit` in various scenarios:
       - If less than one argument is provided.
       - If the `-version` argument is provided.
       - If no program is specified or an unrecognized program is given.
       - If `phonopy` is chosen but an unrecognized quantum mechanics (QM) program is specified.
       - If the specified file does not exist.
       - When critical configuration issues are encountered.

   Notes
   -----
   - It is assumed that `print_help`, `Utilities.find_program_from_name`, and `Utilities.get_reader` are defined elsewhere.
   - The function makes extensive use of `sys.argv` for argument parsing and `sys.stderr` for error and status messaging.
   - The function supports a flexible addition of program types and respective validation.
   - The handling of `-debug`, `-help`, `-version`, and program-specific arguments provides an example of a rudimentary command-line interface.


.. py:function:: print_help()

   Prints the help message for the p1reader program to stderr.

   This function displays the usage of the `p1reader` command, including accepted programs, flags, and additional
   optional arguments.

   Notes
   -----
   This function directly prints to `sys.stderr` and exits the program, it does not return any value.
   It also prints the current version of the PDielec library being used.

   Examples
   --------
   To display the help message, simply call the function without any arguments:

   >>> print_help()


.. py:data:: version
