   .. py:method:: _read_alat(line)

      Read and set the lattice parameter from a given line of text.

      This method processes a line of text, aiming to extract and set the lattice parameter
      for the current object. The value is directly sought from a specified position in the line,
      then adjusted if necessary to match a predefined standard unit conversion threshold. 
      This method does not return any value.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line of text from which the lattice parameter is to be read.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The function checks if the extracted lattice parameter is within a certain threshold (`0.0001`)
      of a predefined conversion factor (`angs2bohr`). If so, it adjusts the lattice parameter to exactly
      match this conversion factor. This functionality assumes that `angs2bohr` is defined elsewhere
      and is accessible within the scope of this method. Also assumes that `self._alat` has been 
      initialized prior, possibly as `None`, and `self.debug` is a boolean indicating whether debug
      prints should be activated.



   .. py:method:: _read_alat2(line)

      Read and set the lattice parameter from a given line.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line from which the lattice parameter is read. It is assumed that the lattice parameter can be found at the third whitespace-separated value in the line.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Attributes Modified
      -------------------
      _alat
          The lattice parameter is set or adjusted within this instance based on the value read from `line`. It is adjusted to `angs2bohr` if the absolute difference between the read value and `angs2bohr` is less than 0.0001.

      Notes
      -----
      This method does not return any value. It updates the `_alat` attribute of the class instance with the value read from the input line, after applying necessary conversions and checks.



   .. py:method:: _read_born_charges(line)

      Read and parse Born charges from a file.

      This internal method reads the Born charges of `nions` ions from the file specified by `file_descriptor` and updates the `born_charges` attribute of the class instance.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          Dummy argument which is overwritten
      self.nions : int
          The number of ions to read Born charges for.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This method reads three lines for each ion, each line corresponding to one of the three Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). It expects each line to contain three space-separated values, which represent the components of the Born charge tensor for that direction.

      This method directly modifies the `born_charges` attribute of the class instance, appending a 3x3 list (representing the Born charge tensor) for each ion.

      If `self.debug` is True, it prints a debug message upon completion.



   .. py:method:: _read_cell_parameters(line)

      Read and parse cell parameters from a given line in the input file.

      This method parses the cell parameters from a specific line in the input file, updating the internal
      state with the scaled lattice vectors and their corresponding unit cell added to the list of unit cells.
      Additionally, this method updates the total number of cells and the volume of the last unit cell read.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          A string representing a line from the input file that contains cell parameters.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The function expects the `line` input to contain the lattice parameter as its third value after removing parentheses.
      Each subsequent line read from the input file (after the parameter line) is expected to represent the lattice vectors,
      scaled by the lattice parameter and converted from Angstroms to Bohr radii.
      The method directly modifies the object's state by updating the `unit_cells` list, `ncells`, and `volume` attributes.



   .. py:method:: _read_celldm1(line)

      Process and update the class attribute _alat based on a line from a file.

      This function is intended to read and process a line that contains a unit of length. It updates the class attribute `_alat` after converting the value properly and checks for conformity within a tolerance. If `debug` is set to True in the class, it also prints the updated `_alat` value.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line read from a file which contains the value to be processed. It's expected that the relevant value is the third element of the line when split by whitespace, and it may contain a comma which should be ignored.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      - Presumes the existence of a class attribute `_alat` which is updated by this function.
      - Assumes `angs2bohr` is a predefined constant available within the scope of this method for conversion or comparison purposes.
      - Uses a tolerance of 0.0001 for deciding whether the processed value matches `angs2bohr`, in which case it precisely sets `_alat` to `angs2bohr`.
      - The `debug` attribute of the class controls whether an update operation is printed or not.



   .. py:method:: _read_dyng_basis_vectors()

      Read and process lattice vectors from a dynG file, then updates unit cell information.

      This private method reads the next three lines from an open file, each representing the a, b, and c vectors of a unit cell, respectively. Each vector is scaled according to the attribute `_alat` and a conversion factor from Angstroms to Bohrs. It then updates the list of unit cells with a new `UnitCell` object created from these vectors, recalculates the total number of cells, updates the volume attribute to the volume of the latest unit cell, and, if debug mode is active, prints the volume. Finally, it calls another method to read masses.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Attributes Updated

      This method reads atomic positions from a line, updating the mass, atomic type list, ions per type, and species list. It scales the coordinates according to the conversion from Angstroms to Bohr units and updates the corresponding `unit_cells` properties.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Attributes Updated

      The routine only reads the gamma point matrix

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The last line read

      Returns
      -------
      None



   .. py:method:: _read_dyng_epsilon(line)

      Read and process zero frequency optical permittivity data from the dynG file.

      This method reads the next four lines from a file, processes them to extract optical dielectric constant data, and stores this data in the instance's `zerof_optical_dielectric` attribute. Specifically, it skips the first line, then reads three lines of numeric values, where each line contains at least three numeric values which are converted to floats and stored in a 2D list assigned to `zerof_optical_dielectric`.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The last line read

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      - This method modifies the instance attribute `zerof_optical_dielectric` directly.
      - If the instance attribute `debug` is set to True, this method prints the `zerof_optical_dielectric` attribute after it is updated.



   .. py:method:: _read_dyng_file(line)

      Read a dynG file.

      This method the dynG output file from a qe ph.x calculation of IR intensities

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The first line of input in the dyng file

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      Calls
      - `_read_dyng_header`
      - `_read_dyng_basis_vectors`
      - `_read_dyng_masses`
      - `_read_dyng_coordinates`



   .. py:method:: _read_dyng_header()

      Read and process the header line from the dynG file.

      This method updates the object's state by reading the header line from the set file descriptor and parsing it to extract the number of species (nspecies), the number of ions (nions), and the lattice parameter (alat) after converting it to Bohr units if it is within a tolerance range of the conversion factor.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The function assumes that the file has been opened and that the file descriptor is stored in `self.file_descriptor`. The header line is expected to contain at least four space-separated values, with the first, second, and fourth values being integers representing the number of species, the number of ions, and a float representing the lattice parameter, respectively. The `angs2bohr` constant is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code and is used as a threshold for converting the lattice parameter to Bohr units. If the `debug` attribute of the object is set to True, it prints the lattice parameter after conversion or identification.

      This method modifies the state of the object by setting `nspecies`, `nions`, and `_alat` based on the contents of the header line.



   .. py:method:: _read_dyng_masses()

      Read the masses of species from an dynG file and populate mass and species lists.

      This method parses lines from an already opened file object (`file_descriptor`), extracting species names and their corresponding masses, which are then adjusted by multiplying by 2 and dividing by the atomic mass unit (amu). The extracted species names are capitalized and stored, along with the calculated masses, in their respective class attributes. If debugging is enabled, it prints the loaded masses. It also calls `_read_dyng_coordinates` method before finishing, passing an empty string as an argument.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None 

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Attributes Modified
      -------------------
      - `masses_per_type` : list
          A list that this method populates with the calculated masses for each species.
      - `species` : list
          A list that this method populates with the capitalized species names.

      Notes
      -----
      - The atomic mass unit (`amu`) is defined elsewhere
      - It's assumed that `_read_dyng_coordinates` is a method within the same class that takes a single string argument.



   .. py:method:: _read_electrons(line)

      Read and store the number of electrons from a line.

      This private method extracts and stores the number of electrons 
      from a given line, assuming the number of electrons is specified 
      in the 5th position of the line when split by whitespace. 
      If the debug attribute is set to True, it prints out the value 
      of electrons read.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line from which to read the number of electrons.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This method modifies the state of the object by setting the 
      'electrons' attribute based on the input line.



   .. py:method:: _read_energy(line)

      Parse the energy values from a given line and set them to the instance variables.

      This function extracts energy-related values from a provided line of text, then calculates and assigns these values (in electron volts) to instance attributes for final energy without entropy and final free energy, while considering conversion factors. If debugging is enabled, it prints the final free energy.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          A string containing energy-related information, expected to follow a pre-determined format where the relevant energy value is the fourth element in a whitespace-separated list.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      See Also
      --------
      hartree2ev : Constant used for conversion from Hartree to electron volts.

      Notes
      -----
      - Assumes that 'hartree2ev' is a predefined conversion constant available in the scope where this function is defined.
      - Utilizes the fourth element in the whitespace-separated list from the input string, after splitting, for the relevant energy-related value.
      - The energy value is converted to electron volts, halved, and then assigned to both 'final_energy_without_entropy' and 'final_free_energy' attributes of the object.
      - If the 'debug' attribute of the object is True, the final free energy is printed.



   .. py:method:: _read_energy_cutoff(line)

      Parse and set the energy cutoff from a line of text.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line of text containing the energy cutoff information. The expected
          format is such that the relevant numerical value is the fourth element (index 3)
          of the whitespace-separated entries.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This method directly modifies the `energy_cutoff` attribute of the class instance
      by setting it to the parsed value converted from Hartree to electron volts (eV) and
      divided by 2. The conversion factor `hartree2ev` is expected to be defined elsewhere
      in the code.

      This method optionally prints a debug message with the new energy cutoff value if
      the instance's `debug` attribute is `True`.



   .. py:method:: _read_fractional_coordinates(line)

      Read the log file and sets the fractional coordinates and element names for the last unit cell in the object.

      This function iterates over a specified number of lines (defined by `self.nions`) from the object's file descriptor, parsing each line into species names and their fractional coordinates. These species names and coordinates are then used to set the corresponding properties for the last unit cell managed by the object. Additional side-effects include updating the total number of unit cells (`self.ncells`) and the volume of the last unit cell (`self.volume`), with the option to print the volume if debugging is enabled.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The initial line from which to start reading the fractional coordinates. The actual parameter is not used within the function but symbolically represents the starting point for reading. 

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      - The function directly modifies the object's state by setting properties of the last unit cell (`self.unit_cells[-1]`) and updating `self.ncells` and `self.volume`.
      - Only operates if `self.nions` is greater than 0.
      - The function is intended to be called in a context where `self.file_descriptor` is already open and positioned correctly.



   .. py:method:: _read_kpoint_grid(line)

      Read and set the k-point grid from a line in a file.

      This method reads a line from the file associated with the file_descriptor attribute, parses the first three elements of the line as floating-point numbers, and sets them as the k-point grid. If the debug attribute is set to True, it prints the k-point grid.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line from which to read the k-point grid. Note that while this parameter is named 'line', it is not used directly in the function as the function reads the next line from the file itself.

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This function modifies the state of the object by setting the `kpoint_grid` attribute to the parsed k-point grid values.



   .. py:method:: _read_kpoints(line)

      Read and store the number of k-points from a given line.

      This is an internal method that extracts the number of k-points from a provided line (assumed to contain this information in a predefined format) and stores it in the class instance. Optionally, it prints debug information if the debug mode is activated.

      Parameters
      ----------
      line : str
          The line from which the number of k-points is extracted. The line should contain the number of k-points at the 5th position (index 4 when split by whitespace).

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      This method modifies the state of the object by setting the `kpoints` attribute.



   .. py:method:: _read_nions(line)

      Read the number of ions from a line and update the object's nions attribute.

      The number of ions is expected to be the fifth element in the line when split by space.

      Parameters

          The pressure value is expected to be at the 6th position in this string 
          (index 5 when zero-indexed) and will be divided by 10.0 to convert from kbar to GPa

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
