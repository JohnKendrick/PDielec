PDielec.phonopy_pdielec_born
============================

.. py:module:: PDielec.phonopy_pdielec_born

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   PDielec interface program to Phonopy.

   The program reads the phonopy.yaml file and the BORN file.
   The BORN file must be created using the standard Phonopy tools
   The program writes out the static permittivity and the Born charges in a format similar to Phonopy's.   But all atoms in the unit cell are in the file.  Not just the symmetry unique ones.

   phonopy-pdielec-born BORN-PDIELEC
       This command writes out the permitivity and the Born charges to the file "BORN-PDIELEC"

.. py:function:: main()

   Define the main routine for the phonopy-pdielec-born command.

   The routine makes extensive use of Phonopy's API
   It reads the phonopy.yaml file to determine the primitive cell
   then it reads the BORN file, before writing out the permitivity and Born charges.
   The output file is formatted in a similar way to the BORN file, but
   all the atoms/ions are present, not just the symmetry unique ones.

   Options:
   -symprec 1.0E-5       Sets the precision used in determing the symmetry (default is 1.0E-5)
   -input   BORN         Sets the input Born charges file (Defaults is BORN)
   -output  BORN_PDIELEC Sets the output Born charges file 
   -yaml    phonopy.yaml Sets the output Born charges file (Defaults is phonopy.yaml)
   -nosym                Stops symmetry being used in parsing the BORN file


.. py:function:: show_usage()

   Show the usage message.
