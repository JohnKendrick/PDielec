.. py:class:: PhonopyOutputReader(names, qmreader)


   Bases: :py:obj:`PDielec.GenericOutputReader.GenericOutputReader`

   Read the contents of a directory containing Phonopy input and output files.

   Inherits from GenericOutputReader


   .. py:method:: _read_output_files()

      Read the Phonopy files in the directory.

      Uses the qmreader to read in the electronic structure information and copies it to the current object.
      Then it reads the dynamical matrix from phonopy


   .. py:method:: read_dynamical_matrix()

      Read and process the dynamical matrix from output files.

      This method reads the dynamical matrix and other relevant data from the specified
      output files, calculates the Hessian matrix, converts its units, and computes the
      eigenvalues and eigenvectors to determine frequencies and mass-weighted normal modes.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None explicitly, but relies on the instance attributes `_outputfiles` and `nions` 
      to determine the files to read and number of ions, respectively.

      Returns
      -------
      None
          This method directly modifies the instance attributes `_old_masses`, `frequencies`, 
          and `mass_weighted_normal_modes` based on the data read and calculations performed.

      Raises
      ------
      FileNotFoundError
          If any of the specified output files cannot be found or opened.
      YAMLError
          If there is an error parsing the YAML files.
      MemoryError
          If there is insufficient memory to compute the eigendecomposition.

      Notes
      -----
      - It first attempts to use the CLoader for parsing YAML files for performance reasons and falls
        back to the standard Loader if CLoader is not available, issuing a warning in such cases.
      - The dynamical matrix is processed to compute real-valued Hessian by considering only the real
        parts. It is then converted to the desired units before computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
      - The method computes frequencies in THz by first converting the eigenvalues from the Hessian to
        the correct units, then calculates the square root of their absolute values, preserving the sign
        to distinguish between real and imaginary modes.
      - Mass-weighted normal modes are then computed for each ion based on the eigenvectors, and the 
        frequencies and normal modes are stored in corresponding instance attributes.
