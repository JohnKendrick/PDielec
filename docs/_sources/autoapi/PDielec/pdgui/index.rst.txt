:py:mod:`PDielec.pdgui`
=======================

.. py:module:: PDielec.pdgui

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   PDgui driver program to calculate dielectric response at infrared and THz frequencies.

   Process command line arguments and start a GUI application with optional splash screen.

   No explicit input parameters are taken by the function. Instead, it parses command line arguments (sys.argv) to configure application behavior. The command line arguments can control displaying a splash screen, application debugging, forcibly exiting, or showing the application version.

   Notes
   -----
       - The -nosplash flag disables the splash screen.
       - The -v, -version, or --version flags print the program version and exit.
       - The -exit or --exit flag forces the program to exit immediately after processing arguments.
       - The -d, -debug, or --debug flags enable debug messages.
       - The function looks for a splash image file in several locations, starting with the executable's directory, and displays it if found unless the splash screen is disabled.
       - If the splash screen is shown, it also includes a progress bar.

   Process command line arguments and start a GUI application with optional splash screen.

   No explicit input parameters are taken by the function. Instead, it parses command line arguments (sys.argv) to configure application behavior. The command line arguments can control displaying a splash screen, application debugging, forcibly exiting, or showing the application version.

   Notes

   - The -nosplash flag disables the splash screen.
   - The -v, -version, or --version flags print the program version and exit.
   - The -exit or --exit flag forces the program to exit immediately after processing arguments.
   - The -d, -debug, or --debug flags enable debug messages.
   - The function looks for a splash image file in several locations, starting with the executable's directory, and displays it if found unless the splash screen is disabled.
   - If the splash screen is shown, it also includes a progress bar.

   Side Effects
   ------------
   - May print the application version and exit if the corresponding flags are detected.
   - May terminate the program execution before initializing the GUI if force_exit is true.
   - Prints debug messages if the debug flag is enabled.
   - Initializes and possibly displays a GUI application, potentially with a splash screen and progress bar.

   Examples
   --------
   Command line usage examples:
   - To run the application with a splash screen and debug messages:

   >>>    pdgui dft_output_file -d

   - To run the application without a splash screen:

   >>>    pdgui dft_output_file -nosplash

   - To print the version of the application and exit:

   >>>    pdgui dft_output_file --version

   - To run a script:

   >>>    pdgui -script script.py
