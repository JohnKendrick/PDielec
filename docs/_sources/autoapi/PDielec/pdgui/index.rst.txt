PDielec.pdgui
=============

.. py:module:: PDielec.pdgui

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   PDgui driver program to calculate dielectric response at infrared and THz frequencies

   Process command line arguments and start a GUI application with optional splash screen.

   No explicit input parameters are taken by the function. Instead, it parses command line arguments (sys.argv) to configure application behavior. The command line arguments can control displaying a splash screen, application debugging, forcibly exiting, or showing the application version.

   Notes
   -----

       - The -nosplash flag disables the splash screen.
       - The -v, -version, or --version flags print the program version and exit.
       - The -exit or --exit flag forces the program to exit immediately after processing arguments.
       - The -d, -debug, or --debug flags enable debug messages.
       - The function looks for a splash image file in several locations, starting with the executable's directory, and displays it if found unless the splash screen is disabled.
       - If the splash screen is shown, it also includes a progress bar.

.. py:class:: App(args, progressbar)

   Bases: :py:obj:`PyQt5.QtWidgets.QMainWindow`


   A class representing the main application window.

   This class initializes the main application window with various configurations based on command line arguments and environment variables. It includes functionalities to read scripts, handle command line inputs, set up multiprocessing or threading as needed, and manage application events.

   Parameters
   ----------
   args : list
       List of command line arguments passed to the application.
   progressbar : QProgressBar
       A progress bar object to display progress of operations in the application.

   Attributes
   ----------
   program_exit : bool
       Flag indicating whether the application should exit after executing any script.
   debug : bool
       Debugging mode flag.
   scripting : bool
       Flag indicating whether the application is running in scripting mode.
   scriptname : str
       The name of the script file to be executed if scripting mode is enabled.
   version : str
       The version of the PDielec package.
   title : str
       The window title.
   left : int
       The x-coordinate of the window's position.
   top : int
       The y-coordinate of the window's position.
   width : int
       The width of the window.
   height : int
       The height of the window.
   notebook : NoteBook
       The notebook widget that acts as the central widget of the application.

   Methods
   -------
   print_usage()
       Prints usage information for the command line interface.
   setMyWindowTitle(title)
       Sets the window title to a formatted string including the version and the given title.
   readScript(scriptname, spreadsheet_name='')
       Executes the commands from a script file and optionally sets the spreadsheet file name.
   closeEvent(event)
       Handles the close event, ensuring that multiprocessing pools are properly closed.


   .. py:method:: closeEvent(event)

      Handle the close event of the application.

      This method is called automatically when the close event is fired, typically when
      the user tries to close the application window. It ensures that the multiprocessing
      pool is properly terminated before the application shuts down.

      Parameters
      ----------
      event : QCloseEvent

      Returns
      -------
      None
          The close event.

      Notes
      -----
      This function must be a method of a class that inherits from a PyQt or PySide 
      widget which has a closeEvent method to override, such as QMainWindow, QDialog, etc.

      The `self.notebook.pool` is an instance of a multiprocessing pool, which needs
      to be closed and joined properly to ensure all processes are terminated cleanly before the application exits.

      The `super(App, self).closeEvent(event)` call makes sure that any close event operations defined in the 
      base class (from which the current class is derived) are also executed.

      When the application is about to close, this method ensures clean termination
      of multiprocessing resources and performs any additional base class close event handling.



   .. py:method:: print_usage()

      Print usage information for the PDielec package's graphical user interface.

      This function prints the general usage information, available commands, and options for the graphical user interface to the PDielec package.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None

      Notes
      -----
      The usage information includes:

      - `program`: The name of the program which created the output file. Supported programs are 'vasp', 'phonopy', 'gulp', 'castep', 'abinit', and 'qe'. The program is guessed from the filename if not specified.
      - `filename`: The name of the output file.
      - `spreadsheet file`: An optional name of a spreadsheet file (must end with .xlsx). If provided, both program and filename must be specified.
      - `-scenario type`: Changes the default scenario to "type", which can be either "powder" or "crystal".
      - `-spreadsheet file`: An alternative way to specify the spreadsheet file.
      - `-program`: An alternative way to specify the program.
      - `-script file`: Specifies that initial commands are read from a script file.
      - `-nosplash`: No splash screen is presented, which is useful for batch running.
      - `-threading`: Use threads instead of multiprocessing.
      - `-cpus 0`: Specify the number of processors or tasks; 0 uses all available.
      - `-version`: Prints the version of the code.
      - `-exit`: Exit the program after executing any script.
      - `-help`: Prints out help information.
      - `-debug`: Switches on debugging information.



   .. py:method:: readScript(scriptname, spreadsheet_name='')

      Read and execute a script, optionally changing the working directory to the script's location and optionally setting a spreadsheet name.

      Parameters
      ----------
      scriptname : str
          The file path of the script to be executed.
      spreadsheet_name : str, optional
          The name of the spreadsheet, default is blank

      Returns
      -------
      None
          The name of the spreadsheet to set in the notebook settings, by default an empty string which implies no spreadsheet name will be set.

      Notes
      -----
      This function changes the current working directory to the directory of the script if its directory part is non-empty. It executes the script in the current Python environment using `exec()`. It also sets various notebook flags such as `scripting` and `overwriting`.

      After executing the script, it potentially updates the spreadsheet name in the notebook's mainTab settings if a non-empty `spreadsheet_name` is provided. It refreshes the notebook and processes pending Qt events with `QCoreApplication.processEvents()`.




   .. py:method:: setMyWindowTitle(title)

      Set the window title with the provided title appended to the PDGui version.

      Parameters
      ----------
      title : str

      Returns
      -------
      None
          The title to be appended after the PDGui version.

      Notes
      -----
      This function modifies the window title attribute of the instance and then updates the actual window title to reflect this change. The version of the PDGui is prefixed to the given title.



.. py:function:: main()

   Process command line arguments and start a GUI application with optional splash screen.

   No explicit input parameters are taken by the function. Instead, it parses command line arguments (sys.argv) to configure application behavior. The command line arguments can control displaying a splash screen, application debugging, forcibly exiting, or showing the application version.

   Notes
   -----
   - The -nosplash flag disables the splash screen.
   - The -v, -version, or --version flags print the program version and exit.
   - The -exit or --exit flag forces the program to exit immediately after processing arguments.
   - The -d, -debug, or --debug flags enable debug messages.
   - The function looks for a splash image file in several locations, starting with the executable's directory, and displays it if found unless the splash screen is disabled.
   - If the splash screen is shown, it also includes a progress bar.

   Side Effects
   ------------
   - May print the application version and exit if the corresponding flags are detected.
   - May terminate the program execution before initializing the GUI if force_exit is true.
   - Prints debug messages if the debug flag is enabled.
   - Initializes and possibly displays a GUI application, potentially with a splash screen and progress bar.

   Examples
   --------
   Command line usage examples:
   - To run the application with a splash screen and debug messages:

   >>>    pdgui dft_output_file -d

   - To run the application without a splash screen:

   >>>    pdgui dft_output_file -nosplash

   - To print the version of the application and exit:

   >>>    pdgui dft_output_file --version

   - To run a script:

   >>>    pdgui -script script.py
