:py:mod:`PDielec.checkexcel`
============================

.. py:module:: PDielec.checkexcel

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The checkexcel package reads in two excel files and check that the float contents are the same

   It is used by the :mod:`~PDielec.pdmake` command to check the validity of the reference calculations in the test suite.

.. py:function:: main()

   Compare two Excel files for any significant numerical changes and report discrepancies.

   This script takes in two Excel files as arguments and optionally,
   a threshold for numerical comparison and a flag for full sheet comparison.

   Full comparison includes 'Settings' and 'Scenarios' sheets by default excluded.

   Parameters
   ----------
   None directly to the function. Parses command line arguments:
   - Two file paths.
   - Optional `-thresh` followed by a float value for the threshold of numerical difference (default is 1.0E-3).
   - Optional `-f` flag for forcing a full comparison including typically excluded sheets.

   Returns
   -------
   tuple
       A tuple containing the following elements:
       - Number of errors (`nerrors`): int
       - Row of the last error or discrepancy (`row`): int
       - Column of the last error or discrepancy (`col`): int
       - Sheet name where the last error or discrepancy was found (`sheet`): str
       - First file name (`file1`): str
       - Value from the first file associated with the last discrepancy (`value1`): float or str
       - Second file name (`file2`): str
       - Value from the second file associated with the last discrepancy (`value2`): float or str
       - Maximum percentage error found during the comparison (`max_percentage_error`): float

   Raises
   ------
   Depends on the Excel library used, typically:
   - `openpyxl.utils.exceptions.InvalidFileException` if an invalid file or path is provided.
   - Other exceptions related to file I/O or processing might be raised depending on the content and structure of the input Excel files.

   Notes
   -----
   - The script will immediately exit with usage instructions if less than two file paths are provided.
   - Numerical difference is calculated only for numeric data. For text data, a simplified equivalence check is done.
   - The script output includes printing to standard error for usage, errors, or status, with optional ANSI color highlighting.
