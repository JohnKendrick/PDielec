version 8.1.1
  The documentation has been revamped.  An API description is now generated from each class and routine.
  The examples of Jupyter notebooks has been added to.
  Static routines have been created in the FitterTab to allow their use in notebooks
  The UnitCell and SuperCell classes have been enhance to use a units specifier
  Added new routines to the Materials and DielectricFunction classes to allow sigmas, oscillator strengths and frequencies to be changed 
  The write_cif() routine in UnitCell has been modified slightly to allow files to be written to
version 8.1.0
  Modifications to the plotter tab to allow the use of wavelength and frequency units
  Redesign of the single crystal scenario tab.  The new design means that scripts are not backwards compatible.
  - The mode setting has altered meaning that backward compatibility is broken.
    The previous options are handled by the layer
    mode can now be 'Transfer matrix' or 'Scattering matrix'
    The default mode is 'Scattering matrix'
  - Thick slab is now an option for an individual layer and has been termed 'Incoherent (non-reflective)'
  - Other incoherent options have been added for a layer, using either intensities or phase matching
  - the pygtm module has been modified so that subclasses are used for coherent and incoherent layers
    and 'Transfer matrix' and 'Scattering matrix' classes are subclasses of the pygtm 'System' class
  - removed the need to have specific super- and sub-strate entries in the singleCrystalTab
    superstrate is the top of the material list and substrate is at the bottom.
  - the old 'Thick slab' option is still available if the dielectric layer is the last in the list of materials
  Updated the progress bar algorithms
  Fixed a bug in the specification of the support matrix for the powder case
  Fixed a bug in the reporting of absorptance, s- and p- were reported the wrong way round
  Fixed a bug in the powder scenario tab, the super- and sub-matrix dielectric functions,
        were not being set properly for frequency dependent permittivities
  Fixed a bug in the plotting tab when writing to the spread-sheet a scalar permittivity
  The option to use slicing has been removed
  The option to do partial incoherence has been removed from the GUI but left in the code

  Modified the AlN test case to use Windows compatibility mode
  Added a slicing option in the single crystal case to address issues with exponential overflow
  Added frequency dependent support matrix capability to the powder simulation
  Added complex permittivity to the support matrix
  Added incoherent light to the single crystal simulation
  Added both partially incoherent thin film mode and incoherent thin film mode
  Included smoothing for the partially incoherent case
  Modified the handling of changing the legend in a scenario so a recalculation is not needed
  Updated the documentation to reflect the new options for incoherent light
  Added a range of units to handle crystal thickness
  Changed the complex matrices in pyGTM to clongdouble
  Modified pyGTM to try and improve its numerical stability
  Added the concept of a slicing to the single crystal scenario, again attempting to improve numerical stability
  Modified the reading of scripts as updates to python seem to have changed the exec() command, now read the whole file at once.
  Add the concept of layers in the single crystal scenarios.
      This allows multiple layers to be treated between the superstrate and substrate
  Added a materials library which can be used to store material properties
  The materials library can be used for powder and single crystal calculations
  There are compatibility issues with previous version, so there may be some scripts which are not compatible.
version 7.2.2
  Addressed problems after changes in numpy.  Some np.int declarations were replaced with int
version 7.2.1
  Addressed problems after changes in numpy 
  numpy.float and numpy.complex now replaced with float and complex
version 7.1.2
  Fixed a bug in the display of bonds when the bond lay along the z-axis
  Fixed bugs associated with selecting modes for inclusion in the permittivity
  Fixed a bug which meant that the mode being displayed by the viewer tab as not correct
  Added the ability to read files with a different extension to the default

  The mode displayed by the viewer tab is now stored in the script file

version 7.1.1
  Minor changes to include the splash image and altered the case of the vibanalysis command

  Major changes to the testing system.  Reliance on make has been removed.
  A new command pdmake has been introduced.
      pdmake tests
      pdmake test-preader
      pdmake test-p2cif
      pdmake vibanalysis
  Each directory in the Examples has a command.pdmake file which describes the test
  A particular test can be started using;
      pdmake command.pdmake
      pdmake --view command.pdmake

version 7.0.2
  Bug fix for changing directory when calling a script

version 7.0.1
  Added a single crystal tab to show transmission and reflectance at a single crystal surface
  The method used is that described by Passler et al
  Rewrote the calculation of dielectric permittivity so that it would be much more general.
  There is now a class which looks after dielectric permittivity information
  The sign convention for the imaginary component of the permittivity has changed - e(real)-e(imag)j
  Moved the CrystalPermittivity to the SettingsTab
  Modified the scripting, scripts written before version 7 may not work. 
  Modified the way masses are handled, so if the gui modifies the masses they are written out to the script.
  Changed the communication between tabs, it was completed before and it still is unfortunately
  Stopped setting the requestRefresh variable directly - now use a subroutine to do it.
  Added a lot of debugging information to the tabs so it is much clearer what the flow is through the code
  Two new input file type has been added 'experimental' and 'pdgui'.
    'experimental' allows an experimental dieletric to be specified this includes a lorentz type spectrum
    'pdgui' allows a script to be read in and executed 'experimental' and 'pdgui'.
    'experimental' allows an experimental dieletric to be specified this includes a lorentz type spectrum
    'pdgui' allows a script to be read in and executed.  
        Scripts read in like this must have the 'program' and 'output file name' specified in the mainTab.settings dictionary.
  The mainTab gui no longer needs to have specified the 'program' name (eg. castep, or vasp). 
      This is determined from the name of the file.
  Added a new example of using the fitter and the fitting tab
  Revised all the documentation
  Added the Mie module from PyMieScatt as there were some issues about crossover
  Major changes to the parallel methods used by the code.  Now using 'partial' from functools
      also removed sending the whole crystal_permittivity array at once.
      also create the pool in the notebook and keep reusing it.
      also switch back to multiprocessing 
  MKL threads are no longer changed by the code


version 6.4.5
  Fixed a couple of problems when switching molecule using the GUI.  The sigmas array and the mode fitting flags are now reset when a new molecule/crystal is read in.
  Modified the ViewerTab to display super-cells
  Added a new VibAnalysis module based on the work of filipe teixeira https://github.com/teixeirafilipe/vibAnalysis
  Example output in Examples/Castep/AsparticAcid/phonon.nm (generated with 'vibanalysis phonon)
                  Examples/Vasp/Na2SO42/OUTCAR.nma (generated with 'vibanalysis OUTCAR)
  Added sklearn to the list of required packages

version 6.4.4 (Internal release only)
  Added an option in viewerTab to write the vibrating molecule as a cif file.
  Modified the cif output format so it is more like that of Mercury
  Introduced psutil.cpu_count as this will give the number of physical processors
  Switched the multiprocessing module to the multiprocess module (pickling is better)
  Overrode the mkl environment variable for the number of threads.  PDgui now uses mkl threading, unless it is in multiprocessing mode.
  Used dill for the pickling itself.
In preader added an option to pickle each of the readers that are created and store them in a file
Added a script, pickled_reader which can read the pickled file.  The script is just an example of how the readers can be read in and the contents accessed.
Modified UnitCell.py to use print_info instead of printInfo
New set of pyhton packages are needed for the above;
dill,multiprocess,psutil
Added new test for p2cif
Removed redundant imports from all files

version 6.4.3
Modified p2cif so that it becomes a windows executable
Modified p2cif and preader to be more robust when reading phonopy output
Re-introduced fitting the frequency scaling in the fitter tab

version 6.4.2
Modified the plotting in fitter so that scaling is always applied
Removed the tick box in the Fitter tab that switches scaling on/off
Only store the optical permittivity in a script if it has been altered in the GUI
This means that older scripts will not be compatible with the newer defaults.

version 6.4.1
Fixed a packaging problem on pypi and conda-forge
No changes to source code

version 6.4.0
Removed the imageio-ffmpeg download code added pip install dependence instead
Updated the installation instructions on the documentation to reflect conda-forge installation
Added environment variables to control threading and number of cpus
Made the refractive_index_medium variable real (not complex) to remove the warning message from PyMieScatt

Version 6.3.1
Solved packaging issues ready for release on PyPi

Version 6.3.0
Added ability to request fewer cpus for parallel computation.  Also can now switch to threading model if necessary.  
Restructured directory structure to be consistent with setup.py
Changed the spreadsheet checking so that 'Settings' is not included - problems with checking degenerate systems
Changed the threshold in checkcsv to 3E-2.  All tests now pass.
Created commands in the root directory which should be similar to those created by a pip installation - pdgui, preader

Version 6.2
Treats the case of a support matrix with spherical inclusions. The scattering from the inclusions is accounted for by Mie theory. The resulting effective permittivity is used in the calculation of the effective permittivity of the active dielectric in the matrix. In addition the following features have been added;

    the sign of the imaginary component of the Mie permittivity is now consistent with Bruggeman and Maxwell-Garnett methods
    a Hodrick-Prescott filter performs a baseline correction to the experimental spectrum in the Fitter tab.
    saving a script has been modified to improve the scripts robustness
    various other minor bugs have been fixed

Version 6.1
Sees the release of new Mie routines which allow a more robust treatment of anisotropic crystals. A few other issues have also been addressed. The mass and volume fractions can be edited more easily. The spreadsheet is now written out at the end of the calculation (on exiting the program). There are several changes to the fitter tab. All the options are now in their own settings tab, which gives more space for listing the frequencies. A new fitting algorithm has been provided, which minimises the root means squared error between the experimental and calculated spectra.

Version 6.0.1 
Is a minor bug-fix release to Version v6.0.

Version 6.0 
Adds the ability to alter the Lorentzian widths of the phonon transitions and compare the results interactively with an experimental spectrum.

version 5.0.0
Removed the command line interface
Added ATR functionality

version 4.0.1
Modified preader to work in parallel under Windows
Changed the complex optical dielectric to real if the imaginary components are 0
Changed the README to give much better information about Windows 10 installations
Modified the shebang on the preader and pdielec commands so that Windows recognises them
Modified the checkcsv command so that it ignores the number of processors

Version 4.0.0
Mie scattering
Excel spread sheet writing completed
Added an 'experiment' program for testing parts of the code without having to do an abinitio calculation.

Version 3.0.1
Added degeneracy checking
Added improved checking of output files, so that small changes due to numpy/mkl choice are ignored
Parallel version of PDielec and preader

Version 3.0.0
Fixed a bug in the way born charges were read in by the Crystal interface.
Added a Phonopy interface (only the VASP driver in Phonopy has been tested)
Added an internal table of masses to PDielec so that a consistent set of masses is used across all QM/MM programs

Version 2.0.1
Fixed a small error in the logic for printing to csv using -csv_ext
Modified the reading of Crystal14 ouput so that the NOECKART flag  in the output file is now ignored and overriden by the PDielec -noeckart flag
Added a -threshold command which allows the user to be more selective as to which modes are included in the absorption calculation

Version 2.0
Updated the code to be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3
In the process of modifying all the print statement, prettified the output
Added a -h -help to print out the usage information
Added a -debug keyword to cut down on some of the output
Added a -csv_ext name flag.  Output is sent to 3 files instead of one
         name_command.csv, name_frequencies.csv and name_spectrum.csv
Added tests to check if any file name given on the command line actually exists or not
Propagated the debug state to any reader
Moved the creation of the Plotter object to early in the code
Used plotter methods print3x3 and printReals to perform printing of arrrays

The command.sh files in the Examples directories have all been modified so that they use the "python" command, not python2 or python3.  These files also all command line parameters to be passed to the executing PDielec command.  This means that
command.sh -plot absorption
will run the example command and a plot of the results will be created.



Version 1.3

Added interfaces to Abinit and Quantum Espresso

There is now a -program castep/vasp/qe etc option
It was getting too hard to think of a unique identifier for the output file!

There is a new, Na2(SO4)2 example which was important because it has very asymmetric born charge matrices.  

I have added an option to use Crystal's symmetrising algorithm, so provided 
the HESSFREQ.DAT and the BORN.DAT files are present and
the "-hessian crystal" option is used, the Crystal frequencies should now agree with Crystal14 output.

There is -eckart flag, which forces PDielec to project out the translational modes.  
The flag works for any package.  It also applies projection to the LO modes.

There is a -LO_cart flag which gives the LO directions in cartesian directions.
This is the same as Abinit, so I was able to test the output against Abinit output.

There are changes in the output, as I now force the mass weighted normal modes to be unitary. 
This improves the Crystal results, but it did change all the other interfaces too. 
The results should still agree to between 4 and 5 significant figures with the old results.

Version 1.2
Added interface to Crystal14
