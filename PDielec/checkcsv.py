def compare_lines( line1, line2, swapped):
  """Compare two lines of text to find and report differences in numerical values.

  Parameters
  ----------
  line1 : str
      The first line of text to be compared.
  line2 : str
      The second line of text to be compared.
  swapped : bool
      A flag indicating if the comparison allows for the first numerical value to be 
      considered as swapped, i.e., if an absolute difference of 1 between the first
      numerical values in each line should be ignored.

  Returns
  -------
  tuple : A tuple containing the following elements:
      - store_error : bool (A flag indicating if an error was stored during comparison.)
      - nerrors : int (The total number of errors detected in the comparison.)
      - max_percentage_error : float (The maximum percentage error found during comparisons.)
      - keep_word1 : str (The word from line1 that resulted in the maximum percentage error.)
      - keep_word2 : str (The word from line2 that resulted in the maximum percentage error.)

  Notes
  -----
  - The function makes use of two globals: `separator`, a string defining how to split
    the lines into words, and `threshold`, a float defining the percentage error
    threshold above which a discrepancy is considered an error.
  - The function compares corresponding numerical values in `line1` and `line2`. Non-numeric 
    words are ignored in the error calculation, but they contribute to the discrepancy count
    if one word is numeric and the corresponding word is not.
  - Special consideration is given to the word "processors" in the fourth position; 
    if present and matching in both lines, it's an immediate pass, regardless of subsequent content.
  - The function also allows for a tolerance in the comparison of the first numeric values 
    of the lines if `swapped` is True, ignoring a discrepancy of exactly 1.

def main():
    """Compare two files line by line to check for significant changes based on a provided threshold.

    This script takes at least two arguments that are file names along with optional arguments for
    separator (`-sep`) and threshold value (`-thresh`). It compares numbers from corresponding lines
    in the two files. A significant change is flagged if the specified comparison formula exceeds
    a given threshold. Defaults to a threshold of 3.0E-2 and treats spaces as the default separator
    for `.txt` and `.out` files, and commas for `.csv` files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None explicitly declared. The function operates on command-line arguments passed to the script.

    - `-sep` : str, optional
        Defines the separator to be used for splitting entries in a line.
        Default is None, which then defaults to spaces for `.txt` and `.out` files,
        and commas for `.csv` files.
    - `-thresh` : float, optional
        The threshold for flagging a difference between the corresponding numbers
        from the two files as significant. Default is 3.0E-2.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing the number of errors found (`nerrors`), the line number with
        the largest percentage difference (`keep_line_number`), the two values with the
        largest difference (`keep_word1` and `keep_word2`), and the maximum percentage
        difference found (`max_percentage_error`).

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If one of the input files does not exist.

    Notes
    -----
    The command-line arguments need to be parsed using `sys.argv`.
