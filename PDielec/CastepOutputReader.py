    Parameters
    ----------

    -----
    - This method assumes that the filenames provided in the list relate to CASTEP calculation outputs. Specifically, it looks for filenames ending in '.castep' or '.phonon' to set up the necessary output files for the instance.

        This method modifies the state of the object by updating the 'zerof_optical_dielectric' and 'zerof_static_dielectric' lists with new data read from the file.
