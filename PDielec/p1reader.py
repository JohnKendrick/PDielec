"""Read the contents of a single file containing DFT output and create a csv style file of information.

Parse command-line arguments to set program configuration and process a specified file.

This function does not have a formal return but exits with different messages and statuses based on the command-line inputs. It processes various command-line arguments to configure the behavior of a software utility, specifically targeting file analysis with support for multiple programs. It also supports debug mode and handles command-line requests for help and version information.

Parameters
----------
This function does not accept parameters directly through its definition. Instead, it uses command-line arguments parsed from `sys.argv`:

- `-debug` : Enable debug mode.
- `-help` : Print help message and exit.
- `-version` : Print software version and exit.
- `-program` : Specify the program to use for analysis. When set to 'phonopy', an additional quantum mechanics program argument is required.
- Any other argument is considered as the filename for analysis.

def print_help():
    """Print the help message for the p1reader program to stderr.

    This function displays the usage of the `p1reader` command, including accepted programs, flags, and additional
    optional arguments.

    Notes
    -----
    This function directly prints to `sys.stderr` and exits the program, it does not return any value.
    It also prints the current version of the PDielec library being used.

    Examples
    --------
    To display the help message, simply call the function without any arguments:

    >>> print_help()

    - Any other argument is considered as the filename for analysis.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        This function may call `exit()` which stops script execution and can be considered as raising `SystemExit` in various scenarios:
        - If less than one argument is provided.
        - If the `-version` argument is provided.
        - If no program is specified or an unrecognized program is given.
        - If `phonopy` is chosen but an unrecognized quantum mechanics (QM) program is specified.
        - If the specified file does not exist.
        - When critical configuration issues are encountered.

    Notes
    -----
    - It is assumed that `print_help`, `Utilities.find_program_from_name`, and `Utilities.get_reader` are defined elsewhere.
    - The function makes extensive use of `sys.argv` for argument parsing and `sys.stderr` for error and status messaging.
    - The function supports a flexible addition of program types and respective validation.
    - The handling of `-debug`, `-help`, `-version`, and program-specific arguments provides an example of a rudimentary command-line interface.
