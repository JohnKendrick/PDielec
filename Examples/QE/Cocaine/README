phonon.scf.in   Input to a single point SCF at the optimised geometry
phonon.ph.in    This is a phonon calculation using the wavefunction from the run above
phonon.log      This is the log of the output files from the SCF and Phonon calculations
cocaine.dynG    This is the dynamical matrix from the phonon calculation

cocaine.dynG is used by PDielec to generate the absorption spectrum.
