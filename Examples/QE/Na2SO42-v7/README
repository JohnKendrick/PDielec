Na2SO42.scf.in   Input to a single point SCF at the optimised geometry - version 7.0
Na2SO42.ph.in    This is a phonon calculation using the wavefunction from the run above - version 7.0
Na2SO42.log      This is the log of the output files from the SCF and Phonon calculations
Na2SO42.dynG     This is the dynamical matrix from the phonon calculation

Na2SO42.dynG is used by PDielec to generate the absorption spectrum.
