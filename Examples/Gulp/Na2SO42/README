The forcefield used in this example has been generated by fitting to data provided by experimental and calculations using VASP.
The fitting data included;
- The experimental geometry
- The elastic constant tensor at the VASP optimised geometry
- The phonon frequencies calculation using the DFPT method VASP
- The high and low frequency dielectric constant tensors

The forcfield uses an ionic model for the Na2(SO4)2.
Two oxygen types were used to represent the oxygen atoms in the crystal.  
All oxygen atoms were represented by a polarisable core-shell model. 
The sulphur and sodium atoms where represented by non-polarisable atoms.
