# Examples/P2Cif
# Tests on the p2cif capability

p2cif is a utility to read DFT output files and generate a cif file.  If the DFT calculation was an optimisation the optimised structure is written.

| **File**       | **Description**                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| all.ref.cif    | The reference cif output used by the test suite               |
| command.pdmake | The pdmake command used by the test suite                     |
| command.sh     | The bash command used by command.pdmake                       |
| files          | A list of output files for which the cif file will be generated |
