phonon.scf.in   Input to a single point SCF at the optimised geometry
phonon.ph.in    This is a phonon calculation using the wavefunction from the run above
phonon.log      This is the log of the output files from the SCF and Phonon calculations
phonon.dynG    This is the dynamical matrix from the phonon calculation

phonon.dynG is used by PDielec to generate the absorption spectrum.

There are two examples in the test given here.  The second test exposes a bug in the output of PWSCF for this calculation.
The output indicates that the mass of Cl is 1.0.  Running the second examples uses isotopic molecular weights and corrects the error.
