ZnO_CPHF.d12    Input to Crystal14
ZnO_CPHF.out    Output from the Crystal14 run
BORN.DAT           Contains the Born charge tensors from the calculation
HESSFREQ.DAT       Contains the hessian from the calculation

The crystal14 run by default projects translation modes out of the hessian.
The presence of the BORN and HESSFREQ.DAT files allows a full precision calculation by PDielec.
In command.sh "-hessian crystal" is specified.  This makes PDielec symmetrise the hessian using
the same method as Crystal14.  In a CPHF calculation Crystal14 calculates epsilon infinity, so
there is no need to pass use -optical or -optical_tensor on the comand line.
The frequencies and the dielectric constants calculated by PDielec in in very good
agreement with those provided by Crystal14.
