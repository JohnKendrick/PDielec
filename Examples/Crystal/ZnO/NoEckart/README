ZnO_noeckart.d12    Input to Crystal14
ZnO_noeckart.out    Output from the Crystal14 run
BORN.DAT            Contains the Born charge tensors from the calculation
HESSFREQ.DAT        Contains the hessian from the calculation

The crystal14 run requested no projection of the hessian.
The presence of the BORN and HESSFREQ.DAT files allows a full precision calculation by PDielec.
In command.sh "-hessian crystal" is specified.  This makes PDielec symmetrise the hessian using
the same method as Crystal14.  The frequencies and the dielectric constants calculated by
PDielec in in very good agreement with those provided by Crystal14.
