Thanks to Tim Kortner's group for providing the example for CRYSTAL14

The files in this directory are as follows;

LEUCINE_FREQUENCY_PBED3_631Gdp_FULLOPTIMIZATON.out
A 631G basis calculation of the frequencies and phonon modes of Leucine

LEUCINE_DIELECTRC_PBED_6311Gdp.out
A calculation of epsilon infinity, which is supplied to PDielec on the command line

LEUCINE_HP_DIELTENS_FREQUENCY_PBED_6311Gdp.out
A 6311G calculation of the frequencies and phonon modes of Leucine. 
This is the example used in command.sh to test the CRYSTAL functionality in PDielec.
