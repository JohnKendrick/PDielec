# A model material used by Mayerhoefer

In a paper Spectrochimica Acta A (2005). 61, 2611â€“2621  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2004.10.002, Mayerhofer uses a toy model material to illustrate using symmetric Euler representations for orientational averaging.  The toy model is a Drude-Lorentz model, with different permittivities along the orthogonal a, b, and c directions.
The calculations reported here are consistent with those reported by Mayerhoefer for single crystal reflectance along each of the a, b and c directions.

These calculations are reported in an application note.
