This calculation was performed using the VASP interface.  A supercell of 1x1x1 was used for a Gamma point calculation
The input for the VASP calculations can be found in INCAR.supercell KPOINTS.supercell POSCAR and POTCAR-index in the VASP/ directory
The calculation of the displaced energies and forces was prepared with;

phonopy -d --dim="1 1 1";

After the Vasp calculations the FORCE_SETS file was calculated with;

phonopy -f */vasprun.xml

The Born charges were calculated using Vasp on a non-supercell and the output is in the VASP/OUTCAR file.  The appropriate KPOINTS and INCAR files are KPOINTS.born and INCAR.born also in the VASP/ directory
Generally speaking the KPOINTS file for the Born charge calculation will be different to that used for the forces calculation. 

phonopy was used to calculate and store the dynamical matrix at the Gamma point with;

phonopy --dim="1 1 1" --qpoints-"0 0 0" --writedm
The output from this command is stored in qpoints.yaml and phonopy.yaml


phonopy band.conf
Was used to generate the band.yaml file.  This contains the displacements of the phonon modes and can be visualised using;
